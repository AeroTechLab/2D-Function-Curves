# Simple Function Curves

Utilities for 2D curves generation and storage using less memory than [lookup tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookup_table), featuring:

- Compose curves of multiple segments, [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial) or [cubic spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_interpolation#Algorithm_to_find_the_interpolating_cubic_spline) based
- Manipulate entire curve scale, offset and range
